🧠 Medical Image Analysis Chatbot

An Industry Project at e-Zest | Award-Winning Solution at Vishwacon, Springer Nature Healthcare Conclave

🚩 Problem Statement
In modern healthcare, radiologists and physicians face significant challenges in interpreting medical images due to overwhelming workloads, shortage of specialists, and time-critical diagnoses. The delay in accurately analyzing medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can hinder early detection and treatment.

To address this challenge, we developed a Medical Image Analysis Chatbot — an intelligent system that assists healthcare professionals and patients by analyzing medical images and providing interpretable insights in a conversational format.

🏆 Recognition
-This project won accolades at:
-Vishwacon – National Conference on AI in Healthcare
